# FR-523: Deploying the ForgeRock Identity Platform™ using DevOps  
  
Notes:  
  
This is the working title of the course based on the initial Front-End Analysis (FEA).  
  
This document is the Instructional Design Document and presentation slides combined into one document.  
  
The hope is to be able to both document and synchronize the design and presentation at the same time.  
  
Changes will be logged in our ForgeRock University Stash (Git) repository:  
  
<https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/UN/repos/fr-523/browse>  
  
The _Notes:_  line separates the slide from the speaker notes.  
  
Experimenting with using RevealJS for slides.  
  
## Preface  
  
Notes:  
  
This is the _Preface_ section which introduces the course goal and objectives and sets the stage for the course.  
  
In Markdown, this is the ## level which denotes a “chapter” in our course structure; however, this is not really a chapter in the true sense.  
  
The next level down in this outline represents the slides for the Preface.  
  
The third heading level ### represents the slide title, while the iThoughtsX notes section contains the slide content and speaker notes.  
  
I am thinking that the third level ### also represents the “Lesson” level in a “Chapter”.  
In that case, it is really a transition slide.  
  
As a refresher, here is the hierarchical structure of our courses from the CBF:  
  
Course title (CG) > Chapter title (IG) > Lesson title (LO) > Enabling Objective title (EO, EO-K, EO-S)  
  
### Course goal  
  
> Deploy ForgeRock software in a containerized environment  
  
Notes:  
  
This is the expected _Final Student Performance_ or Goal for the entire course.  
  
At the end of the course, what do we expect students to be able to do.  
  
The Goal should be written as an objective.  
  
Typically a short sentence/paragraph.  
  
I am using a Markdown quote to present the summary sentence/paragraph.  
  
### Use case(s)  
  
> What is the major use case for this course and what should students be able to do by the end of the course?  
  
Notes:  
  
This is the major use case for the course.  
  
Each instructional level (CG, IG, LO, EO) needs to have both a Goal and Use case description.  
  
### Concepts to learn  
  
What are the desired concepts we need to ensure are taught in this course?  
  
Notes:  
  
This is really not a slide in the presentation, but a placeholder during the _Analysis and Design_ phases to capture this information and then place it somewhere in the objectives of the course.  
  
### Skills to aquire  
  
What are the desired skills we need to ensure are taught in this course?  
  
Notes:  
  
This is really not a slide in the presentation, but a placeholder during the _Analysis and Design_ phases to capture this information and then place it somewhere in the objectives of the course.  
  
### Target audience(s)  
  
Target audience(s) for this course include:  
  
* Partners responsible for deploying ForgeRock products using DevOps techniques  
  
Notes:  
  
It is absolutely essential that the target audience or audiences for this course be properly identified.  
  
### Prerequisites  
  
The following prerequisites are necessary to successfully complete this course:  
  
* Docker  
* Kubernetes  
* Helm  
* Google GKE  
* GitHub account access (for storing configurations)

Notes:  
  
This heading item contains sub-headings that go into more detail.  
  
These sub-headings will likely move to the speaker notes; however, RevealJS has the option to nest slides vertically.  
  
The instructor may or not present nested slides.  
  
#### Docker  
  
<https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>  
  
##### Describe the concepts around Docker and containerization and the terminology used within the Docker community  
  
###### Just Docker  
  
###### Docker engine vs client  
  
* What is the difference between Docker Engine and Docker Client?  
      
    - The docker engine runs the images as containers  
    - The docker client is the utility to manage and run the images  
  
###### Docker and Kubernetes relationship  
  
What is the difference or relationship between Docker and Kubernetes:  
  
- Docker is the container technology solution  
- Kubernetes manages docker containers  
  
Kubernetes is a container orchestration solution.  
Docker Swarm is an alternative to Kubernetes as a container orchestration solution, which is why it is necessary to understand the relationship between Docker and Kubernetes. Do not confuse Docker and Docker Storm as the same thing.

Notes:  
  
As part of the analysis and design, try to identify what the lab environment needs to look like.  
  
Typically, the lab environment mimics a “developers” environment and not production.  
  
Some notes on the CloudShare environment based on the initial analysis:   
  
CloudShare VM:  
  
* Linux  
    * Using Ubuntu - check Helm support: docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#ubuntu-with-kubeadm  
* 2 CPU  
* 8 GB memory  
* 40 GB disk space  
* Software already installed on platform:  
    * Docker client  
    * Kubernetes client  
    * Kubernetes Helm  
    * Kubernetes context switching utilities  
    * Kubernetes log display utility

### Lesson 2: Using the DevOps Quick Start Guide to Deploy the ForgeRock DevOps Examples  
  
#### Goal  
  
> Walk through the instructions of the DevOps Quick Start Guide to demonstrate a deployment of the entire ForgeRock Identity Platform using one Helm chart and then let students perform the same steps on their assigned CloudShare VM.  
  
#### Use case  
  
Students use their assigned CloudShare VM to run through the same steps as presented so they can demonstrate a deployment.  
  
#### State of the CloudShare VM  
  
The CloudShare VM is acting in the role of a local desktop development environment running Minikube:  
  
* Ubuntu 18.04.1 server installed  
* Running a minimal desktop distribution  
* Docker CE 18.06.1-ce is installed  
* `kubectl` client is installed  
* VirtualBox is installed (hypervisor for Kubernetes)  
  
#### Access your assigned CloudShare VM  
  
#### Making your VM Console in CloudShare Visible  
  
* Depends on monitor size  
* Readjust settings to view the VM console window  
* VM console window is necessary because you need to run a browser in the local environment to access the container endpoints  
  
#### Create a Minikube VM  
  
Make sure you have enough disk space on the host system:  
  
`$` **`df -h`**  
  
Create the minikube instance:  
  
`$` **`minikube start --memory=8192 --disk-size=20g --vm-driver=virtualbox --bootstrapper kubeadm`**   
  
Note:  
  
Launch Virtual Box to verify the minikube VM has been created.  
  
#### Verify third-party software is installed  
  
* Docker  
* Kubectl  
* VirtualBox  
* etc  
  
#### Fixing Firefox to Override Security  
  
Helpful to delete `.mozilla` folder if you are unable to see the Advanced button to override the security certificate  
  
#### Deploy the ForgeRock Identity Platform  
  
![Quick Start Deployment](images/flow-quick-start-deploy-platform.svg)
